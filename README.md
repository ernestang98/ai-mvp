# Covid 19 Saliva PCR Test AI Administrator (MVP)

Developed as a minimum viable product to explore the possibility of using AI/Computer Vision to replace the use of physical clinical staff to administer the Covid 19 PCR Saliva Test Kit (as of August 2021, for the results from a Saliva PCR Test Kit to be valid, there is a need for clinical and approved staff to be present on-site to administrate and oversee the entire process)

### Technology:

- OpenCV (Camera Stream)

- Caffe Deep Learning (Face Detector)

- Convolutional Neural Network (Landmarks Detector)

- Multithreading (Reduce lag and increase frame speed)

- Flask (deployment platform)

- Numpy (Basic linear algebra to map 2D screen to 3D space)
